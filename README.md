Hi, I am Beat \[ˈbeːat\] :)

I like:
- doing sports.
- big, world-building Sci-Fi (e.g. Remembrance of the Earth's Past, Foundation)
- long walks with nice people and interesting conversations.

I'm interested in:
- functional programming
- distributed systems
- design thinking/systems thinking
- organizational models
- mathematics (especially category theory)
- creating a better future

I'm currently working on:
- well, have a look at my repos :)

I'm ~~currently~~ _constantly_ working on:
- making my workflows better

And, as you might have noticed:

_Above all, I enjoy learning new things._
